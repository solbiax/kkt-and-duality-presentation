A brief introduction to the KKT conditions and duality theory.

A python notebook about the method of multipliers is also present to give a practical example on the applications of this theory.

The notebook has only been tested using `vscode` and can be easily run by installing the dependencies in a virtual environment. To set the environment up you can run the following commands:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In vscode while running the notebook, when you are prompted to select a python kernel choose `venv`.

If you are using jupyter notebook or windows that's technically known as a "skill issue", so you're on your own.
